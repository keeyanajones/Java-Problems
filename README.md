# Java-Problems
## what does it do
Finding solutions with algorithmic problem solving. Implement and apply algorithms, understand performance analysis, parsing and formatting text, math, data structures, graphs and trees, dynamic programming, and computational geometry.

## what is it
- Common Java Problems
- CREATED : Apr 15, 2018 (2014)

How to implement and apply algorithms, understand performance analysis, parsing and formatting text, math, data structures, graphs and trees, dynamic programming, and computational geometry.  Common topics related to algorithms, success logs, things to revisit later, goals, and lessons learned. 

## technology used
Java 

## ambition of project
keep track of my works with github blog post

## stage
IN DEVELOPMENT

## quick start
Quick setup — if you’ve done this kind of thing before
or

Get started by creating a new file or uploading an existing file. We recommend every repository include a README, LICENSE, and .gitignore.
…or create a new repository on the command line

<pre>
echo "# Java-Problems" >> README.md
git init
git add README.md
git commit -m "first commit"
git remote add origin https://github.com/keeyanajones/Java-Problems.git
git push -u origin master
</pre>                

…or push an existing repository from the command line
<pre>
git remote add origin https://github.com/keeyanajones/Java-Problems.git
git push -u origin master
</pre>

…or import code from another repository

You can initialize this repository with code from a Subversion, Mercurial, or TFS project.
ProTip! Use the URL for this page when adding GitHub as a remote.

## what's included
Problem Solving Process:
    - Probe and Read the problem completely twice, Define the problem completely twice and Determine the problems seriousness
    - Analyze causes, Explore context, Think creatively to brainstorm possible solutions, Generate, and evaluate
    - Choose the best solution alternatives and map out support
    - Solve the problem manually with 3 sets of sample data implementing the solution
    - Optimize and Write the manual steps as comments or pseudo-code
    - Replace the comments or pseudo-code with real code
    - Optimize the code

## Installation
- Tell other users how to install your project locally. Optionally, include a gif to make the process even more clear for other people.
    
## Usage
- instruct other people on how to use your project after they’ve installed it. This would also be a good place to include screenshots of your project in action with typical Problem Solving Process:

  - Probe and Read the problem completely twice, Define the problem completely twice and Determine the problems seriousness
  - Analyze causes, Explore context, Think creatively to brainstorm possible solutions, Generate, and evaluate
  - Choose the best solution alternatives and map out support
  - Solve the problem manually with 3 sets of sample data implementing the solution
  - Optimize and Write the manual steps as comments or pseudo-code
  - Replace the comments or pseudo-code with real code
  - Optimize the code
